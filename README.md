# Predicting CO2 Plume Migration in Heterogeneous Formations by Deep Learning
This Python 3.5 package contains the conditional deep convolutional generative adversarial network (cDC-GAN), which is used to predict the CO2 plume migration and CO2 staturation distribution. 
## Data Files
The training and testing dataset used in this research are collected from commerical reservoir simulation software (CMG), due to the Github space limits, we just upload partical dataset. But total dataset are avaliabel, so please email me if you want to get those data. 
## GAN network structure
For the cDC-GAN design, the generator **__G__** and discriminator **__D__** share a similar structure as used in the pix2pix (i.e., image-to-image mapping) work (Isola et al., 2017), which includes a series of convolutional and deconvolutional layers to help discover high level features at multiple scales. 
## License
The pytorch/python code for the conditional deep convolutional generative adversarial neural network (cDC-GAN) is under MIT license. See the corresponding folders for details.
